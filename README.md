## Overview

**Schinza** is an open-source Windows / macOS desktop tool for local WeChat Official Account (公众号) ops:

| Module | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| **Credential Manager** | Install bundled MITM CA, start local proxy, capture `__biz` / `uin` / `key` / `pass_ticket` from WeChat Desktop; **30‑minute TTL** with renew / copy JSON / **search by name** |
| **History Articles** | Fetch **7 / 30 / 90‑day / all / custom‑day / custom date‑range** history; list export; per‑article or batch body export; optional **URL补录** |
| **List export** | JSON · CSV (Excel) · TSV · Markdown · plain links · title+link |
| **Article export** | Per-article or **batch**: **HTML** · **Markdown** · **TXT** · **JSON** · **Word (.docx)** |
| **Sync Server** | Import Schinza OA list CSV; match local valid credentials by name, then copy or batch upload (≤ 50/batch) to your own open API server |

All credentials and exports stay under local `data/`. The app never uploads automatically — only the **Sync Server** tab can upload matched credentials to the server address you fill in yourself (**no built-in default; you must enter it, e.g. `https://your-server.com/schinza`**).

## UI

Sidebar navigation (dark slate + green accent):

1. **Credential Manager** — CA install, proxy, add & capture, countdown cards  
2. **History Articles** — account · time range · fetch ·补录 · browse · export  
3. **Sync Server** — server URL (required) · import OA list CSV · match credentials · upload  

---

## Requirements

- **Windows** 10 / 11 (x64)
- **macOS** 12.0+ (Monterey or later — WeChat Mac requires macOS 12+; the bundle's own binaries need only 11.0 (arm64))
- WeChat **Desktop** (for credential capture; verified on both Windows & macOS)
- Python **3.11+** (development / build)
- For Windows packaging: OpenSSL DLLs from your Python/conda env (`libssl` / `libcrypto`); macOS packaging needs no extra DLLs

---

## Quick start (from source)

The full-history and background-archive changes live on this fork's
`scalable-archive` branch. The upstream `main` branch does not include them.

**Windows:**

```powershell
git clone --branch scalable-archive https://github.com/MichaelMu151/schinza-wechat-certificate.git
cd schinza-wechat-certificate

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: full mitmproxy CA (with private key) for capture/packaging
# Prefer: %USERPROFILE%\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca.pem

python main.py
```

**macOS:**

```bash
git clone --branch scalable-archive https://github.com/MichaelMu151/schinza-wechat-certificate.git
cd schinza-wechat-certificate

python3 -m venv .venv-mac
.venv-mac/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: full mitmproxy CA (with private key) for capture/packaging
# Prefer: ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca.pem

.venv-mac/bin/python main.py
```

> On macOS, the first **Install CA** uses the `security` command and may prompt for your login password; system proxy setup/restore uses `networksetup` (the active network service is detected automatically).

### Confirm the scalable version

The source entry point remains `main.py`. On the History page the primary
button is **拉取列表并归档** while credentials are valid, or **继续归档正文**
after they expire. There are no article cards or checkboxes; the UI shows
article count, pages, elapsed time, and body progress.

The 30-minute `uin`/`key` window is used **only to page getmsg**. Public
article HTML does not need those keys, so body downloads never compete with
listing. If the window ends before the list is complete, the URLs stay in
`data/history_cache.sqlite` — renew immediately and click again to keep
paging. After the list is complete (or after expiry, via **继续归档正文**),
bodies are written to `data/archives/<account>/` without credentials.

```bash
.venv-mac/bin/python -c "from app import __version__; print(__version__)"
# 1.9.2
```

### First-time capture flow

1. **Credential Manager** → **Install CA** → restart WeChat Desktop  
2. Account name + any article URL → **Add & Capture**; or use **Batch Import** to load a CSV/TXT (column 1 = OA name, column 2 = article URL; comma/tab separated, header auto-detected)  
3. Open any article from that OA in WeChat Desktop  
4. Credentials appear (30‑minute TTL). **Renew** does not open a system browser — refresh the already-open article in WeChat; multi-OA traffic is routed by `__biz`  
5. **History Articles** → pick the account (default: all history) → **拉取列表并归档** while the 30-minute window is live. Listing runs automatically. Bodies start only after the list is complete, or later via **继续归档正文** once credentials expire. No selection is required.

### Conservative body downloads

Body downloads use one request at a time with a randomized **8–15 second**
interval. Transient network failures retry up to twice with increasing waits;
three final failures in a row trigger a 1–2 minute cooldown. The progress view
shows retries and cooldowns.

This reduces request bursts but does not bypass WeChat risk controls. HTTP 429,
`unknownerror`, and frequency-limit pages stop the job immediately. Wait hours
to a day, refresh credentials, then run the same account again to resume.

---

## Troubleshooting (fetch errors)

### "unknown error / unknownerror"
This is **WeChat server-side risk control** (`ret=-6, errmsg=unknownerror`), **not** a local
network/proxy issue: WeChat has flagged the account/session as abnormal and refuses to return
the article list.

- **First check** (network/proxy): Settings → Network & Internet → Proxy → turn off manual proxy,
  then restart the app. A reinstall often just clears leftover proxy state.
- **If network/proxy is fine and it still happens**: the account is rate-limited/flagged. Please:
  - Lower fetch frequency; avoid repeated "All" or bulk fetches across many accounts
  - Wait a while (hours to a day) and retry
  - If it persists, capture with a different WeChat account (avoid your main account)
- Since 1.7.4 the app shows the real reason (e.g. "微信风控拒绝" / "连接微信超时") instead of a bare unknown error.

### "连接微信超时 / 网络错误" (timeout / network error)
Direct connection to `mp.weixin.qq.com` failed: check your network, clear leftover proxy,
restart the app. The app already retries twice automatically.

### "Renew all" / renew does nothing
Renewal depends on WeChat emitting a request that carries **complete credentials**
(`__biz`+`uin`+`key` in the URL, e.g. getappmsgext / getmsg). Just refreshing an
already-open article page may not produce such a request. Please:

1. After starting renewal, **restart WeChat** (so the new proxy/CA takes effect)
2. **Re-open** the article (not just refresh an old tab), or **scroll the OA history
   page** to trigger getmsg
3. Still nothing? Check `data/capture_debug.log`:
   - "截获…凭证不完整" → traffic reaches the proxy but lacks `key`; scroll the history page
   - empty log → WeChat traffic isn't going through the proxy; restart WeChat and retry
   - "凭证已保存" → captured; wait for auto-apply

### "凭证已失效 / 会话异常" (expired / invalid session)
Credentials are valid for 30 minutes — re-capture / renew before fetching.

## Build Windows release

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

```text
dist\Schinza\Schinza.exe
```

Distribute the **whole** `dist\Schinza` folder. Private CA material is required for a capture-capable binary — **never commit private keys**.

## Build macOS release

```bash
./build_mac.sh
```

```text
dist/Schinza.app
```

The script creates a `.venv-mac` virtualenv → copies the CA from `~/.mitmproxy` → generates `.icns` via `sips` + `iconutil` → runs PyInstaller to produce `Schinza.app`. It also builds `dist/Schinza-mac-arm64.dmg` (UDZO, with an Applications symlink for drag-to-install). Private CA material is required for a capture-capable binary — **never commit private keys**.

> The built bundle is currently **Apple Silicon (arm64)** only. Unsigned `.app` binaries need "right-click → Open" on other machines to bypass Gatekeeper; for wide distribution, sign with an Apple Developer ID and notarize.

### System requirements (macOS bundle)

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1 or later) — CI releases ship an arm64 bundle
- **macOS 12.0 (Monterey)** or later — WeChat Mac 4.x requires macOS 12+; the bundle's own binaries require only 11.0 (arm64)
- **WeChat Mac** desktop app installed (required for credential capture; WeChat ships a universal2 build for both architectures)
- An **administrator account** — installing the trust root and setting the system proxy prompt for the login password
- ~300 MB free disk space; 2 GB+ free memory recommended

CI does **not** publish an Intel (x86_64) bundle (the Intel `macos-13` runner was retired). Local users can build one with `./build_mac_x64.sh` — a Rosetta x86_64 venv that produces `dist/Schinza-x64.app` / `dist/Schinza-mac-x64.dmg` (requires Rosetta 2 and a universal2 python.org Python).

## Security & ethics

- Short-lived credentials in `data/accounts.json` only  
- History fetch bypasses the system MITM proxy (`trust_env=False`)  
- Use only on accounts/devices you are authorized to operate  
- Respect WeChat / Tencent terms and applicable laws  
- Do not publish private CA keys or live `uin` / `key` / `pass_ticket`  
- Authors are not responsible for misuse (see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer))
